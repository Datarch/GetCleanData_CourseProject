# GetCleanData_CourseProject

## This repo contains 3 files, as result of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: 

* the 'run_analysis.R' script, which collects, works with, and cleans a data set and to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
* the 'CookBook.md' file, which describes the variables and their transformation used in the run_analysis.R script.
* the 'README.md' file, Which describes how the R script is working.

### This project assignment goals was to createt an R script, which gets the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, creates a tidy dataset and cleans it in order to be used for further analysis.

# Data Source for the project

## The source date can be obtained from here:
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## These data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## The source data should be first downloaded and unzipped to the working directory, in order to start 'run_analysis.R' script.

# The script 'run_analysis.R' does the following:

## Using read.table() function to get all data loaded into R for further processing.

## Features list into 'features' data frame;
## Activity labels list into 'actLabels' data frame;
## Training data set into 'xTrain' data.frame;
## Subject information into 'subjTrain' data frame;
## Activity label information into 'yTrain' data frame;
## Test data set into 'xTest' data frame;
## Subject information into 'subjTest' data frame;
## Activity label information into 'yTest' data frame.

# Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set:

## First the scripts create one data set ('trainData') for training data binding Subject column ('subjTrain') and Activity Label column ('actLabels') information to the training data set ('xTrain').
## Then the scripts create one data set ('testData') for test data binding Subject column ('subjTest') and Activity Label column ('actLabels') information to the test data set ('xTest').
## Finally binding the training data set with test data set into 'mergedData' data frame.

# Labels the variable names and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:

## 

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

##

# Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
